1. if sorted, use binary logic
2. if not sorted , use unordered_set and find in O(1)
3. Check hill peaks points
4. Check valley points and left max hill and right max hil and get minimum of them - valley height
5. In subarrays sort, check the smallest out of order and largest out of order value and get their index
6. In minimum swaps, check the non-intersecting cycles size, min swaps is size-1 of all such cycles
